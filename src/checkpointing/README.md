How to test our dummy implementation
1. Run make. this will produce 2 binary files in the src folder
named save and load.
2. Use cd to move into the src directory. Then run ./save [filename].
3. This will produce a file in the src directory, which we then run
./load [filename]. This will then print to stdout the contents of the
file, showing our dummy implementation.
