Welcome adventurer! You have made your way to the dungeons of the Lavender Palace. Don't be fooled by the cute name! This is one of Throxar the Terrible's most fearsome strongholds... and also his best scented one. Queen Vanadia has tasked you with recovering the Distaff of Knowledge, which her spies assure you is somewhere in these dungeons.

You find yourself in a dungeon room.

The walls are damp and moldy and, yet, the scent of freshly cut lavender flowers pervades the air.

There is a room to the north. A large wooden door leads to the east.

> WALK east

You can't do that, the door is closed.

> LOOK door

It looks very heavy, and it doesn't have a keyhole.

> OPEN door

You can't open the door. It seems to be locked.

> WALK north

You find yourself in a dungeon room.

You shudder to think of the unspeakable horrors that have taken place in these dungeons. You wouldn't want to be fly on the wall here, but mostly because of how damp and moldy the walls are.

You see a sconce holding a candle.

There is a room to the south.

> LOOK sconce

It looks a bit loose.

> TAKE sconce

You can't do that. The sconce is loose, but still firmly attached to the wall.

> PUSH sconce

You can't do that.

> PULL sconce

You pull on the sconce. You hear the sound of a door unlocking in a nearby room.

> PULL sconce

Pulling on the sconce again doesn't seem to do anything.

> WALK south

You find yourself in a dungeon room.

The walls are damp and moldy and, yet, the scent of freshly cut lavender flowers pervades the air.

There is a room to the north. A large wooden door leads to the east.

> WALK east

You can't do that, the door is closed.

> OPEN door

You open the door.

> WALK east

You find yourself in a dungeon room.

The walls are neither damp nor moldy. It looks like they do get around to cleaning them once in a while.

You see the Distaff of Knowledge 

> LOOK distaff

The Distaff of Knowledge is an ancient magical artifact that can be used to weave knowledge itself. It will come in very handy at dinner parties.

> TAKE distaff

You take the Distaff of Knowledge.

CONGRATULATIONS! You have completed your quest.
