Welcome adventurer! You find yourself in the castle of Throxar the Terrible, who has stolen the Orb of Enlightment from the Wizards' Guild. You must retrieve it!

> LOOK

You are in the entrance hall of the castle of Throxar the Terrible. 

You are surprised to see no soldiers guarding the entrance. Maybe they're taking a break?

You see a table.

An open door leads to the east.

> INVENTORY

Your inventory is empty!

> LOOK table

It is rather unremarkable.

The Orb of Enlightment is on the table.

> LOOK orb

It shines with an alluring glare. You can't believe the object of your quest is right here in the entrance hall.

> TAKE orb

As you touch the Orb, a bolt of searing pain courses through your body. How could you have forgotten? The Wizardmaster warned you that only someone in posession of a magical artifact can pick up the Orb.

> WALK east

You find yourself in a magnificent hall.

> LOOK

You are in a magnificent hall. 

Magnificent columns line the walls, which are themselves quite magnificent. The paintings on the ceiling are breathtaking and, yes, rather magnificent. Say what you will about Throxar the Terrible: he may have slaughtered entire nations, but at least he's got good taste in interior decorating.

You see a pedestal.

An open door leads to the west.

> LOOK pedestal

This is the most magnificent pedestal you have ever seen. Come to think of it, it's the first pedestal you've ever seen.

The Talisman of Wilfrax the Wise is on the pedestal.

> LOOK talisman

You may not know much about talismans, but you know a magical artifact when you see one.

> TAKE talisman

You take the Talisman of Wilfrax the Wise.

> INVENTORY

Your inventory contains 1 item:
- The Talisman of Wilfrax the Wise.

> WALK west

You find yourself in the entrance hall of the castle of Throxar the Terrible.

> TAKE orb

You take the Orb of Enlightment.

CONGRATULATIONS! You have completed your quest.
